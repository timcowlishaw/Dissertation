description: A catalogue of the combinator birds (Data.Aviary.Birds etc.) -
             these modules are intended more for illustration than utility.
             .
             Data.Aviary.Functional - operations from Applicative, Monad
             etc. with their types specialized to the function type. This
             might be usefulfor /bird-watching/ i.e. spotting instances
             where an Applicative, Monad or whatever operation corresponds
             to a combinator bird. Again this module is not intended for
             actual use.
             .
             Plus a smaller set (Data.Aviary) intended to be useful,
             collecting combinators that have already /escaped/ (published
             elsewhere) but aren\'t in Data.Function, along with some
             personal favourites.
             .
             Changelog:
             .
             0.2.3 added Data.Aviary.BirdsVersion - same as the original
             Birds module, but with type signatures following a
             revised naming scheme.
             .
             0.2.2 added Data.Aviary.Functional - Applicative, Monad etc.
             signatures specialized to the function type.
             .
             0.2.1 added @dup@ and the /combiner/ variants of cardinal-prime.
             .
             0.2.0 added Haddock docs for @(\#\#)@.
